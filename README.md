This Android project consumes an API that shows results, teams and tables of the main championships of Europe. This project is a REST architeture and uses technologies such as Retrofit 2.0 to consume the API through its available URLs and Jackson 2.0, which is with Retrofit, to convert the JSON data to Java Objects in the moment I use the asynchronous call to the URL. It shows championships, league tables, league fixtures, team list, players list, team fixtures, team details, player details and league details. It's used RxJava as well to perform a complete call, combining data from competition, table and fixtures of it, to fill the objects and show them with a better performance, using ORMLite to persist the data to SQLite and show them on the recycler view without connect to the API all the time.
